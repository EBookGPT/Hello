# Chapter 10: Non-Verbal Ways of Saying Hello

Greetings can be transmitted through various non-verbal cues beyond words. While saying "hello" is a common way to greet someone, non-verbal communication adds an extra layer of meaning and interest to the conversation. Understanding non-verbal communication is equally important as mastering verbal salutations.

These non-verbal queues of greeting can be particularly important when people meet in-person or video conferencing as they play a significant role in establishing trust and creating a positive first impression. 

People often judge others within the first few seconds of interaction based on non-verbal communication. Therefore, it’s vital to be aware of the message one’s body may convey while greeting someone. 

In this chapter, we will learn about ten non-verbal ways to greet someone - from a simple smile to complex cultural customs - that can be used to establish a connection effectively. 

Let's dive into the exciting world of non-verbal communication to greet people!
# Chapter 10: Non-Verbal Ways of Saying Hello

As Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson walk around the busy streets of London, they observe the passers-by; some smile, some wave, some nod their heads, and some ignore them altogether.

Dr. Watson, intrigued by their behaviors, asks Sherlock Holmes, "What are these people trying to convey with their non-verbal communication?"

Sherlock Holmes, who loves to observe people, replies, "Their non-verbal behavior is an indication of how they feel or what they are trying to convey. For instance, a nod can signify respect, and a wave can show warmth."

Dr. Watson, keen to learn more, asks, "What are the ten non-verbal ways of saying hello? Can you demonstrate them?"

Sherlock Holmes nods and says, "Sure, Watson. Let me show you ten non-verbal ways of saying hello that have different meanings and origins."

**1. Smile**
The most common way to say hello is through a smile. It conveys warmth and friendliness. The Duchenne smile, where the eyes also smile, is the most effective smile and adds genuineness to communication.

```python
print("Hello, it's good to see you!") # smiling
```

**2. Hand wave**
A wave of the hand from afar can convey greeting. It signifies a gesture of goodwill and happiness. In some cultures, it's customary to wave both hands, like in Japan.

```python
print("Hey, there! *waves hand*") # waving hello
```

**3. Bow**
In some Asian countries, people bow to honour one another. A bow while saying hello is a show of respect.

```python
print("Namaste, *bows* how are you?") # bowing hello
```

**4. Eye Contact**
Eye contact is a non-verbal way to show interest and authenticity. A good eye contact blended with a smile builds trust.

```python
print("Hi, *maintains good eye contact* how can I assist you?") # greeting with eye contact
```

**5. Head Nod**
Often, people use a simple head nod to send a message of recognition and acknowledgment.

```python
print("Hello, *nods head* how are you doing today?") # greet with head nod
```

**6. Hug**
A hug is a more intimate way to greet someone, often reserved for close friends and family.

```python
print("Hey friend, *opens arms for a hug* how are you doing?") # hugging hello
```

**7. Fist Bump or high five**
Fist bumps or high fives are signs of a friendly, casual hello or congratulations.

```python
print("Hey dude, *offers fist for a bump* what's up?") # fist bump hello
```

**8. Salute**
A salute is a formal greeting or sign of respect in many cultures, especially the military.

```python
print("Hello, *salutes* Sir. Reporting for duty.") # saluting hello
```

**9. Peace sign**
A peace sign or V sign with fingers signifies goodwill and positivity.

```python
print("Hi everyone, *gives a peace sign* hope you all are doing great.") # peace sign hello
```

**10. Wink**
A wink can be a friendly, casual greeting but also used to share a secret or signal.

```python
print("Hi there, *winks* can I talk to you for a moment?") # winking hello
```

Sherlock Holmes concludes, "These are the ten non-verbal ways to greet someone. The key to mastering these greetings is to understand which greeting is appropriate in a given situation and culture."

Dr. Watson says, "Fascinating, Holmes! Now, I can communicate effectively beyond words."

Sherlock Holmes smiles and replies, "Indeed, Watson. Non-verbal communication is a powerful tool that can enhance relationships and make communication more effective. Let's practice these greetings the next time we meet someone new!"

The duo continues their walk, analyzing the non-verbal communication of passers-by, silently observing and pondering the meaning behind every movement.
In the Sherlock Holmes mystery, we explored ten non-verbal ways to greet someone. To make the story engaging, we used Python code snippets to demonstrate each greeting.

Each Python code example used the print() function of Python, which is used to print the string message to the console. The string message is the greeting used to demonstrate each corresponding non-verbal greeting. 

For instance, in the first code example, we wrote:

```python
print("Hello, it's good to see you!") # smiling
```
This code demonstrates a non-verbal hello through a smile. When this code is run, it will print the string message "Hello, it's good to see you!" on the console. 

Similarly, we used a few more code examples to demonstrate different non-verbal greetings in the Sherlock Holmes mystery. By using Python code, we made it easy for readers to understand and visualize the non-verbal greetings. 

Overall, the use of Python code in the Sherlock Holmes mystery added an interactive and engaging element to the chapter, making it easier for readers to comprehend and learn the non-verbal ways to greet someone.
